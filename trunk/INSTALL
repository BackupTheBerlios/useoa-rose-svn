UseOA-ROSE INSTALL
================================================================================

UseOA-ROSE depends on the OpenAnalysis library and the ROSE library.

The build system for UseOA-ROSE uses autotools

Once the above two environment variables are set, UseOA-ROSE can be
built by typing:
    % ./autogen.sh
    % ./configure --with-rose=PATH_TO_ROSE_INSTALL \
                  --with-openanalysis=PATH_TO_OPENANALYSIS_INSTALL \
                  --prefix=INSTALLATION_PATH
    % make
    % make install

The following executables are generated:
    OATest
    CtoOA
    ...

It is also possible to set environment variables such as CXX, CXXFLAGS, etc.
for incorporation into the build process.  For example,
    % setenv CXXFLAGS '-g -O0'
