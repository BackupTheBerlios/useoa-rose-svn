UseOA-ROSE INSTALL
================================================================================

UseOA-ROSE depends on the OpenAnalysis library and the ROSE library.

The build system for UseOA-ROSE requires that the following two
environment variables be set:
    OADIR - should be set to the path to the OpenAnalysis directory
    ROSEDIR - should be set to the path to a ROSE build directory

Once the above two environment variables are set, UseOA-ROSE can be
built by typing:
    % make

The following executables are generated:
    OATest
    CtoOA
    ...

It is also possible to set environment variables such as CXX, CXXFLAGS, etc.
for incorporation into the build process.  For example,
    % setenv CXXFLAGS '-g -O0'
