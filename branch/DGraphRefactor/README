Building UseOA-ROSE:
--------------------

    Works with OpenAnalysis trunk, svn revision 116, and rose-0.8.7a.

    Everything was compiled with g++3.3.3

    To build:
    - edit Makefile.inc, set variables as needed
    - type make 

    Variables you'll likely have to edit in Makefile.inc
    - GLOBAL_DEFINES
    - PROFILE_OPTIONS 
    - topsrcdir
    - ROSE_INST_ROOT
    - OPENANALYSIS_DIR
    - OPENANALYSIS_ARCH


Regression testing system:
--------------------------

    What is a regression test?  According to Wikipedia [1]:

    "Regression testing is any type of software testing which seeks to uncover
    regression bugs. Regression bugs occur whenever software functionality that
    previously worked as desired stops working or no longer works in the same
    way that was previously planned. Typically regression bugs occur as an
    unintended consequence of program changes."

    UseOA-ROSE includes scripts that run regression tests on OpenAnalysis to
    verify its analysis managers, IR interfaces, and interface implementations
    (specifically the implementation for ROSE).


    To run all tests:
        - source scripts/regressAll.script.

    To run a specific regression test script:
        - source scripts/regress<NameOrTest>.script

    To add a new test case to an existing test script:
        All regression tests have a .test file that specifies what files the
        regression test works on.  This script is processed by a python script
        (createRegScripts.py) that creates two addition scripts:  the
        regress<NameOfTest> script and the gen<NameOfTest> script.  To add a
        new test case one need only add the case to the .test file and
        reprocess the file with createRegScripts.py:

        - edit scripts/<NameOfTest>.test
        - append to file "test:: <name of input file>, checked by ???
            - the three question marks specify that the test hasn't been
              verified yet.
        - cd scripts
        - ./genScripts.py <NameOfTest>.test
            - regress<NameOfTest>.script and gen<NameOftest>.script should now
              have been generated.
        - generate the test output by running the gen script (cd..; source
          scripts/gen<NameOfTest>.script)
        - look at the output files generated in TestResults/ for the test case
          added.  Manually verify that this is the correct output.  If you get
          correct output:
            - edit the .test file and replace '???' with your initials for the
              correct test case.
            - ./genScripts.py <NameOfTest>.test
            - add the output for the newly verified test case to the subversion
              repository

    To create a completly new test script:
        - cd scripts
        - cp template.test <NameOfTest>.test
        - edit <NameOfTest>.test and fill in blanks
        - add test cases to the script as described by the above section "To
          add a new test case to an existing test script".

    
    For additional information about the regression testing system consult the
    documentation on the OpenAnalysis website and the comments in
    scripts/createRegScripts.py.


How to run a benchmark:
-----------------------
    - If you want profile information from OpenAnalysis, which most likely
      you do:
        - change directories to your openanalysis directory
        - export CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -g -pg"
        - make -f Makefile.quick configure
        - make -f Makefile.quick install
    - Next recompile UseOA-ROSE for profiling
        - export PROFILE_OPTIONS "-pg -g -O3"
        - make clean
        - make
    - Run your benchmarks
        - ./OABenmark.py [filesFile] [algorithm]
            - Ex. ./OABenchmark small.files --oa-FIAliasAliasMap
        - Now wait for a looooong time
        - Look at the produced .profile files.
